
machine learning (ml) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. it is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks. a subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers; but not all machine learning is statistical learning. the study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning. in its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.

aviation is the activities surrounding mechanical flight and the aircraft industry. aircraft includes fixed-wing and rotary-wing types, morphable wings, wing-less lifting bodies, as well as lighter-than-air craft such as hot air balloons and airships.
aviation began in the 18th century with the development of the hot air balloon, an apparatus capable of atmospheric displacement through buoyancy. some of the most significant advancements in aviation technology came with the controlled gliding flying of otto lilienthal in 1896; then a large step in significance came with the construction of the first powered airplane by the wright brothers in the early 1900s. since that time, aviation has been technologically revolutionized by the introduction of the jet which permitted a major form of transport throughout the world.

technology is the sum of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings. systems (e.g. machines) applying technology by taking an input, changing it according to the system's use, and then producing an outcome are referred to as technology systems or technological systems.
the simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. the prehistoric invention of shaped stone tools followed by the discovery of how to control fire increased sources of food. the later neolithic revolution extended this, and quadrupled the sustenance available from a territory.  the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment.
developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale.
technology has many effects. it has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of earth's environment. innovations have always influenced the values of a society and raised new questions in the ethics of technology. examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.
philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. neo-luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.

artificial intelligence (ai) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals, which involves consciousness and emotionality. the distinction between the former and the latter categories is often revealed by the acronym chosen. 'strong' ai is usually labelled as artificial general intelligence (agi) while attempts to emulate 'natural' intelligence have been called artificial biological intelligence (abi). leading ai textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving".as machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of ai, a phenomenon known as the ai effect. a quip in tesler's theorem says "ai is whatever hasn't been done yet." for instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be ai, having become a routine technology. modern machine capabilities generally classified as ai include successfully understanding human speech, competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and go), and also imperfect-information games like poker, self-driving cars, intelligent routing in content delivery networks, and military simulations.artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1955, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "ai winter"), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding. after alphago successfully defeated a professional go player in 2015, artificial intelligence once again attracted widespread global attention. for most of its history, ai research has been divided into sub-fields that often fail to communicate with each other. these sub-fields are based on technical considerations, such as particular goals (e.g. "robotics" or "machine learning"), the use of particular tools ("logic" or artificial neural networks), or deep philosophical differences. sub-fields have also been based on social factors (particular institutions or the work of particular researchers).the traditional problems (or goals) of ai research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects. agi is among the field's long-term goals. approaches include statistical methods, computational intelligence, and traditional symbolic ai. many tools are used in ai, including versions of search and mathematical optimization, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability and economics. the ai field draws upon computer science, information engineering, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.
the field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it". this raises philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence. these issues have been explored by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity. some people also consider ai to be a danger to humanity if it progresses unabated. others believe that ai, unlike previous technological revolutions, will create a risk of mass unemployment.in the twenty-first century, ai techniques have experienced a resurgence following concurrent advances in computer power, large amounts of data, and theoretical understanding; and ai techniques have become an essential part of the technology industry, helping to solve many challenging problems in computer science, software engineering and operations research.


data are units of information, often numeric, that are collected through observation. in a more technical sense, data are a set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables about one or more persons or objects, while a datum (singular of data) is a single value of a single variable.although the terms "data" and "information" are often used interchangeably, these terms have distinct meanings. in some popular publications, data are sometimes said to be transformed into information when they are viewed in context or in post-analysis. however, in academic treatments of the subject data are simply units of information. data are used in scientific research, businesses management (e.g., sales data, revenue, profits, stock price), finance, governance (e.g., crime rates, unemployment rates, literacy rates), and in virtually every other form of human organizational activity (e.g., censuses of the number of homeless people by non-profit organizations).
data are measured, collected and reported, and analyzed, and from data visualizations such as graphs, tables or images are produced.  data as a general concept refers to the fact that some existing information or knowledge is represented or coded in some form suitable for better usage or processing. raw data ("unprocessed data") is a collection of numbers or characters before it has been "cleaned" and corrected by researchers. raw data needs to be corrected to remove outliers or obvious instrument or data entry errors (e.g., a thermometer reading from an outdoor arctic location recording a tropical temperature).  data processing commonly occurs by stages, and the "processed data" from one stage may be considered the "raw data" of the next stage. field data is raw data that is collected in an uncontrolled "in situ" environment. experimental data is data that is generated within the context of a scientific investigation by observation and recording.
data has been described as the new oil of the digital economy.

a city is a large human settlement. it can be defined as a permanent and densely settled place with administratively defined boundaries whose members work primarily on non-agricultural tasks. cities generally have extensive systems for housing, transportation, sanitation, utilities, land use, production of goods, and communication. their density facilitates interaction between people, government organisations and businesses, sometimes benefiting different parties in the process, such as improving efficiency of goods and service distribution. due to the efficiency of transportation and the smaller land consumption, dense cities hold the potential to have a smaller ecological footprint per inhabitant than more sparsely populated areas. therefore, compact cities are often referred to as a crucial element of fighting climate change. however, this concentration can also have significant negative consequences, such as forming urban heat islands, concentrating pollution, and stressing water supplies and other resources.
historically, city-dwellers have been a small proportion of humanity overall, but following two centuries of unprecedented and rapid urbanization, more than half of the world population now lives in cities, which has had profound consequences for global sustainability. present-day cities usually form the core of larger metropolitan areas and urban areas—creating numerous commuters traveling towards city centres for employment, entertainment, and edification. however, in a world of intensifying globalisation, all cities are to varying degrees also connected globally beyond these regions. this increased influence means that cities also have significant influences on global issues, such as sustainable development, global warming and global health. because of these major influences on global issues, the international community has prioritized investment in sustainable cities through sustainable development goal 11.
other important traits of cities besides population include the capital status and relative continued occupation of the city. for example, country capitals such as abu dhabi, amsterdam, athens, beijing, berlin, brasília, buenos aires, cairo, canberra, copenhagen, helsinki, lisbon, london, madrid, mexico city, moscow, new delhi, ottawa, paris, rome, san josé, santiago, seoul, tokyo, taipei, ulaanbaatar, warsaw, and washington, d.c. reflect their nation's identity. some historic capitals, such as kyoto, maintain their reflection of cultural identity even without modern capital status. religious holy sites offer another example of capital status within a religion, jerusalem, mecca, varanasi, ayodhya, haridwar and prayagraj each hold significance. the cities of faiyum, damascus, delhi and argos are among those laying claim to the longest continual inhabitation.

an atmosphere is a layer or a set of layers of gases surrounding a planet or other material body, that is held in place by the gravity of that body. an atmosphere is more likely to be retained if the gravity it is subject to is high and the temperature of the atmosphere is low.
the atmosphere of earth is composed of nitrogen (about 78%), oxygen (about 21%), argon (about 0.9%), carbon dioxide (0.04%) and other gases in trace amounts. oxygen is used by most organisms for respiration; nitrogen is fixed by bacteria and lightning to produce ammonia used in the construction of nucleotides and amino acids; and carbon dioxide is used by plants, algae and cyanobacteria for photosynthesis. the atmosphere helps to protect living organisms from genetic damage by solar ultraviolet radiation, solar wind and cosmic rays. the current composition of the earth's atmosphere is the product of billions of years of biochemical modification of the paleoatmosphere by living organisms.
a stellar atmosphere is the outer region of a star and typically includes the portion above the opaque photosphere. stars with sufficiently low temperatures may have outer atmospheres with compound molecules.







the universe (latin: universus) is all of space and time and their contents, including planets, stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy. the big bang theory is the prevailing cosmological description of the development of the universe. according to estimation of this theory, space and time emerged together 13.7990.021 billion years ago, and the universe has been expanding ever since. while the spatial size of the entire universe is unknown, the cosmic inflation equation tells us that it must have a minimum diameter of 23 trillion light years, and it is possible to measure the size of the observable universe, which is approximately 93 billion light-years in diameter at the present day.
the earliest cosmological models of the universe were developed by ancient greek and indian philosophers and were geocentric, placing earth at the center. over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led nicolaus copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the sun at the center of the solar system. in developing the law of universal gravitation, isaac newton built upon copernicus's work as well as johannes kepler's laws of planetary motion and observations by tycho brahe.
further observational improvements led to the realization that the sun is one of hundreds of billions of stars in the milky way, which is one of a few hundred billion galaxies in the universe. many of the stars in our galaxy have planets. at the largest scale, galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the universe has neither an edge nor a center. at smaller scales, galaxies are distributed in clusters and superclusters which form immense filaments and voids in space, creating a vast foam-like structure. discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the universe had a beginning and that space has been expanding since then at an increasing rate.according to the big bang theory, the energy and matter initially present have become less dense as the universe expanded. after an initial accelerated expansion called the inflationary epoch at around 1032 seconds, and the separation of the four known fundamental forces, the universe gradually cooled and continued to expand, allowing the first subatomic particles and simple atoms to form. dark matter gradually gathered, forming a foam-like structure of filaments and voids under the influence of gravity. giant clouds of hydrogen and helium were gradually drawn to the places where dark matter was most dense, forming the first galaxies, stars, and everything else seen today.
from studying the movement of galaxies, it has been discovered that the universe contains much more matter than is accounted for by visible objects; stars, galaxies, nebulas and interstellar gas. this unseen matter is known as dark matter (dark means that there is a wide range of strong indirect evidence that it exists, but we have not yet detected it directly). the cdm model is the most widely accepted model of our universe. it suggests that about 69.2%1.2% [2015] of the mass and energy in the universe is a cosmological constant (or, in extensions to cdm, other forms of dark energy, such as a scalar field) which is responsible for the current expansion of space, and about 25.8%1.1% [2015] is dark matter. ordinary ('baryonic') matter is therefore only 4.84%0.1% [2015] of the physical universe. stars, planets, and visible gas clouds only form about 6% of the ordinary matter.there are many competing hypotheses about the ultimate fate of the universe and about what, if anything, preceded the big bang, while other physicists and philosophers refuse to speculate, doubting that information about prior states will ever be accessible. some physicists have suggested various multiverse hypotheses, in which our universe might be one among many universes that likewise exist.

wikipedia ( (listen) wik-ih-pee-dee- or  (listen) wik-ee-) is a free, multilingual online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteer contributors through a model of open collaboration, using a wiki-based editing system. wikipedia is the largest and most-read reference work in history, and is consistently one of the 15 most-popular websites as ranked by alexa; as of 2021, it ranked as the 13th most-popular site. the project carries no advertisements and is hosted by the wikimedia foundation, an american non-profit organization funded mainly through individual donations.wikipedia was launched on january 15, 2001, by jimmy wales and larry sanger; sanger coined its name as a portmanteau of "wiki" and "encyclopedia". initially available only in english, versions in other languages were quickly developed. the english wikipedia, with 6.3 million articles as of may 2021, is the largest of the 321 language editions. combined, wikipedia's editions comprise more than 56 million articles, and attract more than 17 million edits and more than 1.7 billion unique visitors per month.wikipedia has received praise for its enablement of the democratization of knowledge, extent of coverage, unique structure, culture, and reduced amount of commercial bias, but has also been criticized for its perceived unreliability and for exhibiting systemic bias, namely racial bias and gender bias against women, and alleged ideological bias. in 2006, time magazine stated that the open-door policy of allowing anyone to edit had made wikipedia the "biggest and perhaps the best encyclopedia in the world", and a testament to the vision of jimmy wales. in 2018, facebook and youtube announced that they would help users detect fake news by suggesting links to related wikipedia articles.

linux ( (listen) leen-uuks or  lin-uuks) is a family of open-source unix-like operating systems based on the linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on september 17, 1991, by linus torvalds. linux is typically packaged in a linux distribution.
distributions include the linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the gnu project. many linux distributions use the word "linux" in their name, but the free software foundation uses the name "gnu/linux" to emphasize the importance of gnu software, causing some controversy.popular linux distributions include debian, fedora, and ubuntu. commercial distributions include red hat enterprise linux and suse linux enterprise server. desktop linux distributions include a windowing system such as x11 or wayland, and a desktop environment such as gnome or kde plasma. distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether, or include a solution stack such as lamp. because linux is freely redistributable, anyone may create a distribution for any purpose.linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the intel x86 architecture, but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system. because of the dominance of the linux-based android on smartphones, linux also has the largest installed base of all general-purpose operating systems. although it is used by only around 2.3 percent of desktop computers, the chromebook, which runs the linux kernel-based chrome os, dominates the us k12 education market and represents nearly 20 percent of sub-$300 notebook sales in the us. linux is the leading operating system on servers (over 96.4% of the top 1 million web servers' operating systems are linux), leads other big iron systems such as mainframe computers, and is the only os used on top500 supercomputers (since november 2017, having gradually eliminated all competitors).linux also runs on embedded systems, i.e. devices whose operating system is typically built into the firmware and is highly tailored to the system. this includes routers, automation controls, smart home technology (like google nest), televisions (samsung and lg smart tvs use tizen and webos, respectively), automobiles (for example, tesla, audi, mercedes-benz, hyundai, and toyota all rely on linux), digital video recorders, video game consoles, and smartwatches. the falcon 9's and the dragon 2's avionics use a customized version of linux.linux is one of the most prominent examples of free and open-source software collaboration. the source code may be used, modified and distributed commercially or non-commercially by anyone under the terms of its respective licenses, such as the gnu general public license.90% of all cloud infrastructure is powered by linux including supercomputers and cloud providers. 74% of smartphones in the world are linux-based.

machine learning (ml) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. it is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks. a subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers; but not all machine learning is statistical learning. the study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning. in its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.

science (from the latin word scientia, meaning "knowledge") is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.the earliest roots of science can be traced to ancient egypt and mesopotamia in around 3000 to 1200 bce. their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical world based on natural causes. after the fall of the western roman empire, knowledge of greek conceptions of the world deteriorated in western europe during the early centuries (400 to 1000 ce) of the middle ages, but was preserved in the muslim world during the islamic golden age. the recovery and assimilation of greek works and islamic inquiries into western europe from the 10th to 13th century revived "natural philosophy", which was later transformed by the scientific revolution that began in the 16th century as new ideas and discoveries departed from previous greek conceptions and traditions. the scientific method soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and it was not until the 19th century that many of the institutional and professional features of science began to take shape; along with the changing of "natural philosophy" to "natural science."modern science is typically divided into three major branches that consist of the natural sciences (e.g., biology, chemistry, and physics), which study nature in the broadest sense; the social sciences (e.g., economics, psychology, and sociology), which study individuals and societies; and the formal sciences (e.g., logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science), which study abstract concepts. there is disagreement, however, on whether the formal sciences actually constitute a science as they do not rely on empirical evidence. disciplines that use existing scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such as engineering and medicine, are described as applied sciences.new knowledge in science is advanced by research from scientists who are motivated by curiosity about the world and a desire to solve problems. contemporary scientific research is highly collaborative and is usually done by teams in academic and research institutions, government agencies, and companies. the practical impact of their work has led to the emergence of science policies that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by prioritizing the development of commercial products, armaments, health care, public infrastructure, and environmental protection.

an army (from latin arma "arms, weapons" via old french arme, "armed" [feminine]), ground force or land force is a fighting force that fights primarily on land. in the broadest sense, it is the land-based military branch, service branch or armed service of a nation or state. it may also include aviation assets by possessing an army aviation component. within a national military force, the word army may also mean a field army.
in some countries, such as france and china, the term "army", especially in its plural form "armies", has the broader meaning of armed forces as a whole, while retaining the colloquial sense of land forces. to differentiate the colloquial army from the formal concept of military force, the term is qualified, for example in france the land force is called arme de terre, meaning land army, and the air and space force is called arme de l'air et de lespace, meaning air and space army. the naval force, although not using the term "army", is also included in the broad sense of the term "armies"  thus the french navy is an integral component of the collective french armies (french armed forces) under the ministry of the armies. a similar pattern is seen in china, with the people's liberation army (pla) being the overall military, the land force being the pla ground force, and so forth for the pla air force, the pla navy, and other branches.

by convention, irregular military is understood in contrast to regular armies which grew slowly from personal bodyguards or elite militia. regular in this case refers to standardized doctrines, uniforms, organizations, etc. regular military can also refer to full-time status (standing army), versus reserve or part-time personnel. other distinctions may separate statutory forces (established under laws such as the national defence act), from de facto "non-statutory" forces such as some guerrilla and revolutionary armies. armies may also be expeditionary (designed for overseas or international deployment) or fencible (designed for  or restricted to  homeland defence).

reform (latin: reformo) means the improvement or amendment of what is wrong, corrupt, unsatisfactory, etc. the use of the word in this way emerges in the late 18th century and is believed to originate from christopher wyvill's association movement which identified parliamentary reform as its primary aim. reform is generally regarded as antithetical to revolution.
developing countries may carry out a wide range of reforms to improve their living standards, often with support from international financial institutions and aid agencies. this can include reforms to macroeconomic policy, the civil service, and public financial management.
in the united states, rotation in office or term limits would, by contrast, be more revolutionary, in altering basic political connections between incumbents and constituents.

a ship is a large watercraft that travels the world's oceans and other sufficiently deep waterways, carrying goods or passengers, or in support of specialized missions, such as defense, research, and fishing. ships are generally distinguished from boats, based on size, shape, load capacity, and tradition. in the age of sail a "ship" was a sailing vessel defined by its sail plan of at least three square rigged masts and a full bowsprit.
ships have supported exploration, trade, warfare, migration, colonization, and science. after the 15th century, new crops that had come from and to the americas via the european seafarers significantly contributed to the world population growth. ship transport is responsible for the largest portion of world commerce.
as of 2016, there were more than 49,000 merchant ships, totaling almost 1.8 billion dead weight tons. of these 28% were oil tankers, 43% were bulk carriers, and 13% were container ships.

a train is a form of rail transport consisting of a series of connected vehicles that generally run along a railroad (or railway) track to transport passengers or cargo (also known as "freight" or "goods"). the word "train" comes from the old french trahiner, derived from the latin trahere meaning "to pull" or "to draw".motive power for a train is provided by a separate locomotive or individual motors in a self-propelled multiple unit. the term "engine" is often used as an alternative to locomotive. although historically steam propulsion dominated, the most common types of locomotive are diesel and electric, the latter supplied by overhead wires or additional rails. trains can also be hauled by horses, pulled by engine or water-driven cable or wire winch, run downhill using gravity, or powered by pneumatics, gas turbines or electric batteries.
the track usually consists of two running rails with a fixed spacing, which may be supplemented by additional rails such as electric conducting rails ("third rail") and rack rails. monorails and maglev guideways are also occasionally used.passenger trains include passenger-carrying vehicles and can often be very long and fast. high-speed rail systems began expanding rapidly in the late 20th century, and this remains a major subject of further development. the term "light rail" is sometimes used to refer to a modern tram system, but it may also mean an intermediate form between a tram and a train, similar to a heavy rail rapid transit system.
freight (goods) trains use freight cars (or wagons/trucks) to transport goods or materials (cargo). it is possible to carry passengers and freight in the same train using a mixed consist.
rail cars and machinery that are used for the maintenance and repair of tracks, are termed "maintenance of way" equipment; these may be assembled into maintenance of way trains. similarly, dedicated trains may be used to provide support services to stations along a train line, such as garbage or revenue collection.

world war ii or the second world war, often abbreviated as wwii or ww2, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. it involved the vast majority of the world's countriesincluding all the great powersforming two opposing military alliances: the allies and the axis powers. in a state of total war, directly involving more than 100 million personnel from more than 30 countries, the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. aircraft played a major role in the conflict, including the strategic bombing of population centres, and, with the development of nuclear weapons, the only two uses of such in war. world war ii was the deadliest conflict in human history, resulting in 70 to 85 million fatalities, with more civilians than military personnel killed. tens of millions of people died due to genocides (including the holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease.  in the wake of the war, germany and japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against german and japanese leaders.
world war ii is generally considered to have begun on 1 september 1939, when nazi germany, under adolf hitler, invaded poland. the united kingdom and france subsequently declared war on the 3rd. under the molotovribbentrop pact of august 1939, germany and the soviet union had partitioned poland and marked out their "spheres of influence" across finland, romania and the baltic states. from late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, germany conquered or controlled much of continental europe, and formed the axis alliance with italy and japan (along with other countries later on). following the onset of campaigns in north africa and east africa, and the fall of france in mid-1940, the war continued primarily between the european axis powers and the british empire, with war in the balkans, the aerial battle of britain, the blitz of the uk, and the battle of the atlantic. on 22 june 1941, germany led the european axis powers in an invasion of the soviet union, opening the eastern front, the largest land theatre of war in history and trapping the axis powers, crucially the german wehrmacht, in a war of attrition.
japan, which aimed to dominate asia and the pacific, was at war with the republic of china by 1937. in december 1941, japan attacked american and british territories with near-simultaneous offensives against southeast asia and the central pacific, including an attack on the us fleet at pearl harbor which forced the us to declare war against japan; the european axis powers declared war on the us in solidarity. japan soon captured much of the western pacific, but its advances were halted in 1942 after losing the critical battle of midway; later, germany and italy were defeated in north africa and at stalingrad in the soviet union. key setbacks in 1943including a series of german defeats on the eastern front, the allied invasions of sicily and the italian mainland, and allied offensives in the pacificcost the axis powers their initiative and forced it into strategic retreat on all fronts. in 1944, the western allies invaded german-occupied france, while the soviet union regained its territorial losses and turned towards germany and its allies. during 1944 and 1945, japan suffered reversals in mainland asia, while the allies crippled the japanese navy and captured key western pacific islands.
the war in europe concluded with the liberation of german-occupied territories, and the invasion of germany by the western allies and the soviet union, culminating in the fall of berlin to soviet troops, hitler's suicide and the german unconditional surrender on 8 may 1945. following the potsdam declaration by the allies on 26 july 1945 and the refusal of japan to surrender on its terms, the united states dropped the first atomic bombs on the japanese cities of hiroshima, on 6 august, and nagasaki, on 9 august. faced with an imminent invasion of the japanese archipelago, the possibility of additional atomic bombings, and the soviet entry into the war against japan and its invasion of manchuria, japan announced its intention to surrender on 15 august, then signed the surrender document on 2 september 1945, cementing total victory in asia for the allies.
world war ii changed the political alignment and social structure of the globe. the united nations (un) was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts, and the victorious great powerschina, france, the soviet union, the united kingdom, and the united statesbecame the permanent members of its security council. the soviet union and the united states emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the nearly half-century-long cold war. in the wake of european devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonisation of africa and asia. most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion. political integration, especially in europe, began as an effort to forestall future hostilities, end pre-war enmities and forge a sense of common identity.

nuclear power is the use of nuclear reactions to produce electricity. nuclear power can be obtained from nuclear fission, nuclear decay and nuclear fusion reactions. presently, the vast majority of electricity from nuclear power is produced by nuclear fission of uranium and plutonium in nuclear power plants. nuclear decay processes are used in niche applications such as radioisotope thermoelectric generators in some space probes such as voyager 2. generating electricity from fusion power remains the focus of international research. 
civilian nuclear power supplied 2,586 terawatt hours (twh) of electricity in 2019, equivalent to about 10% of global electricity generation, and was the second-largest low-carbon power source after hydroelectricity. as of january 2021, there are 442 civilian fission reactors in the world, with a combined electrical capacity of 392 gigawatt (gw). there are also 53 nuclear power reactors under construction and 98 reactors planned, with a combined capacity of 60 gw and 103 gw, respectively. the united states has the largest fleet of nuclear reactors, generating over 800 twh zero-emissions electricity per year with an average capacity factor of 92%. most reactors under construction are generation iii reactors in asia.
nuclear power has one of the lowest levels of fatalities per unit of energy generated compared to other energy sources. coal, petroleum, natural gas and hydroelectricity each have caused more fatalities per unit of energy due to air pollution and accidents. since its commercialization in the 1970s, nuclear power has prevented about 1.84 million air pollution-related deaths and the emission of about 64 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent that would have otherwise resulted from the burning of fossil fuels.
accidents in nuclear power plants include the chernobyl disaster in the soviet union in 1986, the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster in japan in 2011, and the more contained three mile island accident in the united states in 1979.
there is a debate about nuclear power. proponents, such as the world nuclear association and environmentalists for nuclear energy, contend that nuclear power is a safe, sustainable energy source that reduces carbon emissions. nuclear power opponents, such as greenpeace and nirs, contend that nuclear power poses many threats to people and the environment.

the mariana trench or marianas trench is located in the western pacific ocean about 200 kilometres (124 mi) east of the mariana islands; it is the deepest oceanic trench on earth. it is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550 km (1,580 mi) in length and 69 km (43 mi) in width. the maximum known depth is 10,984 metres (36,037 ft) ( 25 metres [82 ft]) (6.825 miles) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the challenger deep. however, some unrepeated measurements place the deepest portion at 11,034 metres (36,201 ft). if hypothetically mount everest were placed into the trench at this point, its peak would still be under water by more than two kilometres (1.2 mi).at the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bars (15,750 psi), more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. at this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%. the temperature at the bottom is 1 to 4 c (34 to 39 f).in 2009, the marianas trench was established as a us national monument. monothalamea have been found in the trench by scripps institution of oceanography researchers at a record depth of 10.6 kilometres (6.6 mi) below the sea surface. data has also suggested that microbial life forms thrive within the trench.

a planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, is not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion, and  according to the international astronomical union but not all planetary scientists  has cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals.the term planet is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. apart from earth itself, five planets in the solar system are often visible to the naked eye. these were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. as scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. in 2006, the international astronomical union (iau) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the solar system. this definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain "planets" under the current definition, some celestial bodies, such as ceres, pallas, juno and vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and pluto (the first trans-neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as planets under the current definition of planet.
the planets were thought by ptolemy to orbit earth in deferent and epicycle motions. although the idea that the planets orbited the sun had been suggested many times, it was not until the 17th century that this view was supported by evidence from the first telescopic astronomical observations, performed by galileo galilei. about the same time, by careful analysis of pre-telescopic observational data collected by tycho brahe, johannes kepler found the planets' orbits were elliptical rather than circular. as observational tools improved, astronomers saw that, like earth, each of the planets rotated around an axis tilted with respect to its orbital pole, and some shared such features as ice caps and seasons. since the dawn of the space age, close observation by space probes has found that earth and the other planets share characteristics such as volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics, and even hydrology.
planets in the solar system are divided into two main types: large low-density giant planets, and smaller rocky terrestrials. there are eight planets in the solar system according to the iau definition. in order of increasing distance from the sun, they are the four terrestrials, mercury, venus, earth, and mars, then the four giant planets, jupiter, saturn, uranus, and neptune. six of the planets are orbited by one or more natural satellites.
several thousands of planets around other stars ("extrasolar planets" or "exoplanets") have been discovered in the milky way. as of 1 may 2021, 4,719 known extrasolar planets in 3,490 planetary systems (including 772 multiple planetary systems), ranging in size from just above the size of the moon to gas giants about twice as large as jupiter have been discovered, out of which more than 100 planets are the same size as earth, nine of which are at the same relative distance from their star as earth from the sun, i.e. in the circumstellar habitable zone. on 20 december 2011, the kepler space telescope team reported the discovery of the first earth-sized extrasolar planets, kepler-20e and kepler-20f, orbiting a sun-like star, kepler-20. a 2012 study, analyzing gravitational microlensing data, estimates an average of at least 1.6 bound planets for every star in the milky way.
around one in five sun-like stars is thought to have an earth-sized planet in its habitable zone.

a massively multiplayer online game (mmog, or more commonly, mmo) is an online game with large numbers of players, often hundreds or thousands, on the same server. mmos usually feature a huge, persistent open world, although there are games that differ. these games can be found for most network-capable platforms, including the personal computer, video game console, or smartphones and other mobile devices.
mmos can enable players to cooperate and compete with each other on a large scale, and sometimes to interact meaningfully with people around the world. they include a variety of gameplay types, representing many video game genres.

space exploration technologies corp. (spacex) is an american aerospace manufacturer and space transportation services company headquartered in hawthorne, california. spacex was founded in 2002 by elon musk with the goal of reducing space transportation costs to enable the colonization of mars. spacex manufactures the falcon 9 and falcon heavy launch vehicles, several rocket engines, dragon cargo and crew spacecraft and starlink communications satellites. 
spacex's achievements include the first privately funded liquid-propellant rocket to reach orbit (falcon 1 in 2008), the first private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft (dragon in 2010), the first private company to send a spacecraft to the international space station (dragon in 2012), the first vertical take-off and vertical propulsive landing for an orbital rocket (falcon 9 in 2015), the first reuse of an orbital rocket (falcon 9 in 2017), and the first private company to send astronauts to orbit and to the international space station (spacex crew dragon demo-2 in 2020). spacex has flown and reflown the falcon 9 series of rockets over one hundred times.
spacex is developing a satellite megaconstellation named starlink to provide commercial internet service. in january 2020 the starlink constellation became the largest satellite constellation in the world. spacex is also developing starship, a privately funded, fully reusable, super heavy-lift launch system for interplanetary spaceflight. starship is intended to become the primary spacex orbital vehicle once operational, supplanting the existing falcon 9, falcon heavy and dragon fleet. starship will be fully reusable and will have the highest payload capacity of any orbital rocket ever on its debut, scheduled for the early 2020s.

the internet (or internet)  is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the internet protocol suite (tcp/ip) to communicate between networks and devices. it is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. the internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the world wide web (www), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.
the origins of the internet date back to the development of packet switching and research commissioned by the united states department of defense in the 1960s to enable time-sharing of computers. the primary precursor network, the arpanet, initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1970s. the funding of the national science foundation network as a new backbone in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial extensions, led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies, and the merger of many networks. the linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s marked the beginning of the transition to the modern internet, and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, personal, and mobile computers were connected to the network. although the internet was widely used by academia in the 1980s, commercialization incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life.
most traditional communication media, including telephony, radio, television, paper mail and newspapers are reshaped, redefined, or even bypassed by the internet, giving birth to new services such as email, internet telephony, internet television, online music, digital newspapers, and video streaming websites. newspaper, book, and other print publishing are adapting to website technology, or are reshaped into blogging, web feeds and online news aggregators. the internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interactions through instant messaging, internet forums, and social networking services. online shopping has grown exponentially for major retailers, small businesses, and entrepreneurs, as it enables firms to extend their "brick and mortar" presence to serve a larger market or even sell goods and services entirely online. business-to-business and financial services on the internet affect supply chains across entire industries.
the internet has no single centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own policies. the overreaching definitions of the two principal name spaces in the internet, the internet protocol address (ip address) space and the domain name system (dns), are directed by a maintainer organization, the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers (icann). the technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols is an activity of the internet engineering task force (ietf), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise. in november 2006, the internet was included on usa today's list of new seven wonders.

iron () is a chemical element with symbol fe (from latin: ferrum) and atomic number 26. it is a metal that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table. it is, by mass, the most common element on earth, right in front of oxygen (32.1% and 30.1%, respectively), forming much of earth's outer and inner core. it is the fourth most common element in the earth's crust.
in its metallic state, iron is rare in the earth's crust, limited mainly to deposition by meteorites. iron ores, by contrast, are among the most abundant in the earth's crust, although extracting usable metal from them requires kilns or furnaces capable of reaching 1,500 c (2,730 f) or higher, about 500 c (900 f) higher than that required to smelt copper. humans started to master that process in eurasia by about 2000 bce, and the use of iron tools and weapons began to displace copper alloys, in some regions, only around 1200 bce. that event is considered the transition from the bronze age to the iron age. in the modern world, iron alloys, such as steel, stainless steel, cast iron and special steels are by far the most common industrial metals, because of their mechanical properties and low cost.
pristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are mirror-like silvery-gray. however, iron reacts readily with oxygen and water to give brown to black hydrated iron oxides, commonly known as rust. unlike the oxides of some other metals, that form passivating layers, rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off, exposing fresh surfaces for corrosion.
the body of an adult human contains about 4 grams (0.005% body weight) of iron, mostly in hemoglobin and myoglobin. these two proteins play essential roles in vertebrate metabolism, respectively oxygen transport by blood and oxygen storage in muscles. to maintain the necessary levels, human iron metabolism requires a minimum of iron in the diet. iron is also the metal at the active site of many important redox enzymes dealing with cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals.chemically, the most common oxidation states of iron are iron(ii) and iron(iii). iron shares many properties of other transition metals, including the other group 8 elements, ruthenium and osmium. iron forms compounds in a wide range of oxidation states, 2 to +7. iron also forms many coordination compounds; some of them, such as ferrocene, ferrioxalate, and prussian blue, have substantial industrial, medical, or research applications.

coronaviruses are a group of related rna viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. in humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause sars, mers, and covid-19. in cows and pigs they cause diarrhea, while in mice they cause hepatitis and encephalomyelitis.
coronaviruses constitute the subfamily orthocoronavirinae, in the family coronaviridae, order nidovirales, and realm riboviria. they are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded rna genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry. the genome size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, one of the largest among rna viruses. they have characteristic club-shaped spikes that project from their surface, which in electron micrographs create an image reminiscent of the solar corona, from which their name derives.

computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task. programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding). the source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. the purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. proficient programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.
tasks accompanying and related to programming include: testing, debugging, source code maintenance, implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer programs. these might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual writing of code. software engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices.  reverse engineering is a related process used by designers, analysts and programmers to understand and re-create/re-implement.

engineering is the use of scientific principles to design and build machines, structures, and other items, including bridges, tunnels, roads, vehicles, and buildings. the discipline of engineering encompasses a broad range of more specialized fields of engineering, each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of applied mathematics, applied science, and types of application. see glossary of engineering.
the term engineering is derived from the latin ingenium, meaning "cleverness" and  ingeniare, meaning "to contrive, devise".

a language is a structured system of communication used by humans, including speech (spoken language), gestures (sign language) and writing. most languages have a writing system composed of glyphs to inscribe the original sound or gesture and its meaning.the scientific study of language is called linguistics. critical examinations of languages, such as philosophy of language, the relationships between language and thought, etc, such as how words represent experience, have been debated at least since gorgias and plato in ancient greek civilization. thinkers such as rousseau (1712  1778) have debated that language originated from emotions, while others like kant (1724 1804), have held that languages originated from rational and logical thought. twentieth century philosophers such as wittgenstein (1889  1951) argued that philosophy is really the study of language itself. major figures in contemporary linguistics of these times include ferdinand de saussure and noam chomsky.
estimates of the number of human languages in the world vary between 5,000 and 7,000. however, any precise estimate depends on the arbitrary distinction (dichotomy) between languages and dialect. natural languages are spoken or signed, but any language can be encoded into secondary media using auditory, visual, or tactile stimuli  for example, in writing, whistling, signing, or braille. in other words, human language is modality-independent, but written or signed language is the way to inscribe or encode the natural human speech or gestures. depending on philosophical perspectives regarding the definition of language and meaning, when used as a general concept, "language" may refer to the cognitive ability to learn and use systems of complex communication, or to describe the set of rules that makes up these systems, or the set of utterances that can be produced from those rules. all languages rely on the process of semiosis to relate signs to particular meanings. oral, manual and tactile languages contain a phonological system that governs how symbols are used to form sequences known as words or morphemes, and a syntactic system that governs how words and morphemes are combined to form phrases and utterances.
human language has the properties of productivity and displacement, and relies on social convention and learning. its complex structure affords a much wider range of expressions than any known system of animal communication. language is thought to have originated when early hominins started gradually changing their primate communication systems, acquiring the ability to form a theory of other minds and a shared intentionality. this development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions. language is processed in many different locations in the human brain, but especially in broca's and wernicke's areas. humans acquire language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently by approximately three years old. the use of language is deeply entrenched in human culture. therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language also has many social and cultural uses, such as signifying group identity, social stratification, as well as social grooming and entertainment.
languages evolve and diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can be reconstructed by comparing modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. a group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a language family; in contrast, a language that has been demonstrated to not have any living or non-living relationship with another language is called a language isolate. there are also many unclassified languages whose relationships have not been established, and spurious languages may have not existed at all. academic consensus holds that between 50% and 90% of languages spoken at the beginning of the 21st century will probably have become extinct by the year 2100.

communication (from latin communicare, meaning "to share") is the act of developing meaning among entities or groups through the use of sufficiently mutually understood signs, symbols, and semiotic conventions.
in claude shannon's and warren weaver's influential model, human communication was imagined to function like a telephone or telegraph. accordingly, they conceptualized communication as involving discrete steps: 

the formation of communicative motivation or reason.
message composition (further internal or technical elaboration on what exactly to express).
message encoding (for example, into digital data, written text, speech, pictures, gestures and so on).
transmission of the encoded message as a sequence of signals using a specific channel or medium.
noise sources such as natural forces and in some cases human activity (both intentional and accidental) begin influencing the quality of signals propagating from the sender to one or more receivers.
reception of signals and reassembling of the encoded message from a sequence of received signals.
decoding of the reassembled encoded message.
interpretation and making sense of the presumed original message.these elements are now understood to be substantially overlapping and recursive activities rather than steps in a sequence. for example, communicative actions can commence before a communicator formulates a conscious attempt to do so, as in the case of phatics; likewise, communicators modify their intentions and formulations of a message in response to real-time feedback (e.g., a change in facial expression). practices of decoding and interpretation are culturally enacted, not just by individuals (genre conventions, for instance, trigger anticipatory expectations for how a message is to be received), and receivers of any message operationalize their own frames of reference in interpretation.the scientific study of communication can be divided into:

information theory which studies the quantification, storage, and communication of information in general;
communication studies which concerns human communication;
biosemiotics which examines communication in and between living organisms in general.
biocommunication which exemplifies sign-mediated interactions in and between organisms of all domains of life, including viruses.the channel of communication can be visual, auditory, tactile/haptic (e.g. braille or other physical means), olfactory, electromagnetic, or biochemical. human communication is unique for its extensive use of abstract language. development of civilization has been closely linked with progress in telecommunication.

waste (or wastes) are unwanted or unusable materials. waste is any substance which is discarded after primary use, or is worthless, defective and of no use. a by-product by contrast is a joint product of relatively minor economic value. a waste product may become a by-product, joint product or resource through an invention that raises a waste product's value above zero. 
examples include municipal solid waste (household trash/refuse), hazardous waste, wastewater (such as sewage, which contains bodily wastes (feces and urine) and surface runoff), radioactive waste, and others.

the industrial revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in europe and the united states, in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. this transition included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, the increasing use of steam power and water power, the development of machine tools and the rise of the mechanized factory system. the industrial revolution also led to an unprecedented rise in the rate of population growth.
textiles were the dominant industry of the industrial revolution in terms of employment, value of output and capital invested. the textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods.the industrial revolution began in great britain, and many of the technological innovations were of british origin. by the mid-18th century britain was the world's leading commercial nation, controlling a global trading empire with colonies in north america and the caribbean, and with major military and political hegemony on the indian subcontinent, particularly with the proto-industrialised mughal bengal, through the activities of the east india company. the development of trade and the rise of business were among the major causes of the industrial revolution.the industrial revolution marks a major turning point in history; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. in particular, average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth. some economists have said the most important effect of the industrial revolution was that the standard of living for the general population in the western world began to increase consistently for the first time in history, although others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th centuries.gdp per capita was broadly stable before the industrial revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy, while the industrial revolution began an era of per-capita economic growth in capitalist economies. economic historians are in agreement that the onset of the industrial revolution is the most important event in the history of humanity since the domestication of animals and plants.the precise start and end of the industrial revolution is still debated among historians, as is the pace of economic and social changes. eric hobsbawm held that the industrial revolution began in britain in the 1780s and was not fully felt until the 1830s or 1840s, while t. s. ashton held that it occurred roughly between 1760 and 1830. rapid industrialization first began in britain, starting with mechanized spinning in the 1780s, with high rates of growth in steam power and iron production occurring after 1800. mechanized textile production spread from great britain to continental europe and the united states in the early 19th century, with important centres of textiles, iron and coal emerging in belgium and the united states and later textiles in france.an economic recession occurred from the late 1830s to the early 1840s when the adoption of the industrial revolution's early innovations, such as mechanized spinning and weaving, slowed and their markets matured. innovations developed late in the period, such as the increasing adoption of locomotives, steamboats and steamships, hot blast iron smelting and new technologies, such as the electrical telegraph, widely introduced in the 1840s and 1850s, were not powerful enough to drive high rates of growth. rapid economic growth began to occur after 1870, springing from a new group of innovations in what has been called the second industrial revolution. these innovations included new steel making processes, mass-production, assembly lines, electrical grid systems, the large-scale manufacture of machine tools and the use of increasingly advanced machinery in steam-powered factories.

hydropower (from greek: , "water"), also known as water power, is the use of falling or fast-running water to produce electricity or to power machines. this is achieved by converting the kinetic energy of water into electrical or mechanical energy. hydropower is a form of sustainable energy production.
since ancient times, hydropower from watermills has been used as a renewable energy source for irrigation and the operation of mechanical devices, such as gristmills, sawmills, textile mills, trip hammers, dock cranes, domestic lifts, and ore mills. a trompe, which produces compressed air from falling water, is sometimes used to power other machinery at a distance.hydropower is an attractive alternative to fossil fuels as it does not directly produce atmospheric pollutants. however, economic, sociological, and environmental downsides limit its use. international institutions such as the world bank view hydropower as a low-carbon means for economic development.


richard milhous nixon (january 9, 1913  april 22, 1994) was the 37th president of the united states, serving from 1969 to 1974.  a member of the republican party, nixon previously served as the 36th vice president from 1953 to 1961, having risen to national prominence as a representative and senator from california. after five years in the white house that saw the conclusion to the u.s. involvement in the vietnam war, dtente with the soviet union and china, and the establishment of the environmental protection agency, he became the only president to resign from the office, following the watergate scandal.
nixon was born into a poor family of quakers in a small town in southern california. he graduated from duke university school of law in 1937 and returned to california to practice law. he and his wife pat moved to washington in 1942 to work for the federal government. he served on active duty in the naval reserves during world war ii. he was elected to the house of representatives in 1946. his pursuit of the hiss case established his reputation as a leading anti-communist which elevated him to national prominence. in 1950, he was elected to the senate. he was the running mate of dwight d. eisenhower, the republican party's presidential nominee in the 1952 election, subsequently serving for eight years as the vice president. he unsuccessfully ran for president in 1960, narrowly losing to john f. kennedy. nixon then lost a race for governor of california to pat brown in 1962. in 1968, he ran for the presidency again and was elected, defeating hubert humphrey and george wallace in a close election.
nixon ended american involvement in vietnam in 1973, ending the military draft that same year. nixon's visit to china in 1972 eventually led to diplomatic relations between the two nations, and he gained the anti-ballistic missile treaty with the soviet union the same year. his administration generally transferred power from federal control to state control. he imposed wage and price controls for 90 days, enforced desegregation of southern schools, established the environmental protection agency, and began the war on cancer. he also presided over the apollo 11 moon landing, which signaled the end of the space race. he was re-elected in one of the largest electoral landslides in american history in 1972 when he defeated george mcgovern.
in his second term, nixon ordered an airlift to resupply israeli losses in the yom kippur war, a war which led to the oil crisis at home. by late 1973, watergate escalated, costing nixon much of his political support. on august 9, 1974, facing almost certain impeachment and removal from office, he became the first american president to resign. afterwards, he was issued a pardon by his successor, gerald ford. in 20 years of retirement, nixon wrote his memoirs and nine other books and undertook many foreign trips, rehabilitating his image into that of an elder statesman and leading expert on foreign affairs. he suffered a debilitating stroke on april 18, 1994, and died four days later at age 81. surveys of historians and political scientists have ranked nixon as a below-average president. however, evaluations of him have proven complex, with his successes as president contrasted against the circumstances of his departure from office.

a watermill or water mill is a mill that uses hydropower. it is a structure that uses a water wheel or water turbine to drive a mechanical process such as milling (grinding), rolling, or hammering. such processes are needed in the production of many material goods, including flour, lumber, paper, textiles, and many metal products. these watermills may comprise gristmills, sawmills, paper mills, textile mills, hammermills, trip hammering mills, rolling mills, wire drawing mills.
one major way to classify watermills is by wheel orientation (vertical or horizontal), one powered by a vertical waterwheel through a gear mechanism, and the other equipped with a horizontal waterwheel without such a mechanism. the former type can be further divided, depending on where the water hits the wheel paddles, into undershot, overshot, breastshot and pitchback (backshot or reverse shot) waterwheel mills. another way to classify water mills is by an essential trait about their location: tide mills use the movement of the tide; ship mills are water mills onboard (and constituting) a ship.
watermills impact the river dynamics of the watercourses where they are installed. during the time watermills operate channels tend to sedimentate, particularly backwater. also in the backwater area, inundation events and sedimentation of adjacent floodplains increase. over time however these effects are cancelled by river banks becoming higher. where mills have been removed, river incision increases and channels deepen.

freedom, generally, is having the ability to act or change without constraint.  something is "free" if it can change easily and is not constrained in its present state. in philosophy and religion, it is associated with having free will and being without undue or unjust constraints, or enslavement, and is an idea closely tied with the concept of liberty. a person has the freedom to do things that will not, in theory, or in practice, be prevented by other forces. outside of the human realm, freedom generally does not have this political or psychological dimension. a rusty lock might be oiled so that the key has the freedom to turn, undergrowth may be hacked away to give a newly planted sapling freedom to grow, or a mathematician may study an equation having many degrees of freedom. in physics or engineering, the mathematical concept may also be applied to a body or system constrained by a set of equations, whose degrees of freedom describe the number of independent motions that are allowed to it.

a vehicle (from latin: vehiculum) is a machine that transports people or cargo.  vehicles include wagons, bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships, boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft),  aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and spacecraft.land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground: wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. iso 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation, for road vehicles types, terms and definitions.

a flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). the biological function of a flower is to facilitate reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) resulting from cross pollination or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower) when self pollination occurs.
pollination have two types which is self-pollination and cross-pollination. self-pollination happens when the pollen from the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same flower, or another flower on the same plant. cross-pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species. self-pollination happened in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flowers stigma. this pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators.some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. after fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds.
in addition to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants, flowers have long been admired and used by humans to bring beauty to their environment, and also as objects of romance, ritual, religion, medicine and as a source of food.

hungary (hungarian: magyarorszg [mrorsa] (listen)) is a country in central europe. it borders slovakia to the north, ukraine to the northeast, romania to the east and southeast, serbia to the south, croatia and slovenia to the southwest, and austria to the west. hungary covers an area of 93,030 square kilometres (35,920 sq mi) in the carpathian basin, with a population of 10 million. hungarian, the official language, is the world's most widely spoken uralic language, and among the few non-indo-european languages widely spoken in europe. budapest is the country's capital and largest city; other major urban areas include debrecen, szeged, miskolc, pcs, and gyr.
the territory of present-day hungary was for centuries inhabited by various peoples, including celts, romans, germanic tribes, huns, west slavs and the avars. the foundations of the hungarian state were established in the late ninth century ad with the conquest of the carpathian basin by hungarian grand prince rpd. his great-grandson stephen i ascended the throne in 1000, converting his realm to a christian kingdom. by the 12th century, hungary became a regional power, reaching its cultural and political height in the 15th century. following the battle of mohcs in 1526, it was partially occupied by the ottoman empire (15411699). hungary came under habsburg rule at the turn of the 18th century, later joining with the austrian empire to form austria-hungary, a major power into the early 20th century.austria-hungary collapsed after world war i, and the subsequent treaty of trianon established hungary's current borders, resulting in the loss of 71% of its territory, 58% of its population, and 32% of ethnic hungarians. following the tumultuous interwar period, hungary joined the axis powers in world war ii, suffering significant damage and casualties. postwar hungary became a satellite state of the soviet union, leading to the establishment of the hungarian people's republic. following the failed 1956 revolution, hungary became a comparatively freer, though still repressive, member of the eastern bloc. the removal of hungary's border fence with austria accelerated the collapse of the eastern bloc, and subsequently the soviet union. on 23 october 1989, hungary became a democratic parliamentary republic. hungary joined the european union in 2004 and has been part of the schengen area since 2007.hungary is a middle power in international affairs, owing mostly to its cultural and economic influence. it has a high-income economy and ranks "very high" in the human development index, with citizens enjoying universal health care and tuition-free secondary education. hungary has a long history of significant contributions to arts, music, literature, sports, science and technology. it is the thirteenth-most popular tourist destination in europe, drawing 15.8 million international tourists in 2017. it is a member of numerous international organisations, including the united nations, nato, wto, world bank, iib, the aiib, the council of europe, and the visegrd group.

a tank is an armored fighting vehicle intended as a primary offensive weapon in front-line ground combat. tank designs are a balance of heavy firepower, strong armor, and good battlefield mobility provided by tracks and a powerful engine; usually their main armament is mounted in a turret. they are a mainstay of modern 20th and 21st century ground forces and a key part of combined arms combat.
modern tanks are versatile mobile land weapons platforms whose main armament is a large-caliber tank gun mounted in a rotating gun turret, supplemented by machine guns or other ranged weapons such as anti-tank guided missiles or rocket launchers. they have heavy vehicle armor which provides protection for the crew, the vehicle's munition storage, fuel tank and propulsion systems. the use of tracks rather than wheels provides improved operational mobility which allows the tank to overcome rugged terrain and adverse conditions such as mud and ice/snow better than wheeled vehicles, and thus be more flexibly positioned at advantageous locations on the battlefield. these features enable the tank to perform well in a variety of intense combat situations, simultaneously both offensively (with direct fire from their powerful main gun) and defensively (as fire support and defilade for friendly troops due to the near invulnerability to common infantry small arms and good resistance against most heavier weapons), all while maintaining the mobility needed to exploit changing tactical situations. fully integrating tanks into modern military forces spawned a new era of combat: armored warfare.

until the arrival of the main battle tank, tanks were typically categorized either by weight class (light, medium, heavy or superheavy tanks) or doctrinal purpose (breakthrough-, cavalry-, infantry- or reconnaissance tanks). some being larger and very heavily armored and with large guns, while others are smaller, lightly armored, and equipped with a smaller caliber and lighter gun. these smaller tanks move over terrain with speed and agility and can perform a reconnaissance role in addition to engaging enemy targets. the smaller, faster tank would not normally engage in battle with a larger, heavily armored tank, except during a surprise flanking manoeuvre.

an aircraft is a vehicle that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. it counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines. common examples of aircraft include airplanes, helicopters, airships (including blimps), gliders, paramotors and hot air balloons.the human activity that surrounds aircraft is called aviation. the science of aviation, including designing and building aircraft, is called aeronautics. crewed aircraft are flown by an onboard pilot, but unmanned aerial vehicles may be remotely controlled or self-controlled by onboard computers. aircraft may be classified by different criteria, such as lift type, aircraft propulsion, usage and others.

a tank is an armored fighting vehicle intended as a primary offensive weapon in front-line ground combat. tank designs are a balance of heavy firepower, strong armor, and good battlefield mobility provided by tracks and a powerful engine; usually their main armament is mounted in a turret. they are a mainstay of modern 20th and 21st century ground forces and a key part of combined arms combat.

modern tanks are versatile mobile land weapons platforms whose main armament is a large-caliber tank gun mounted in a rotating gun turret, supplemented by machine guns or other ranged weapons such as anti-tank guided missiles or rocket launchers. they have heavy vehicle armor which provides protection for the crew, the vehicle's munition storage, fuel tank and propulsion systems. the use of tracks rather than wheels provides improved operational mobility which allows the tank to overcome rugged terrain and adverse conditions such as mud and ice/snow better than wheeled vehicles, and thus be more flexibly positioned at advantageous locations on the battlefield. these features enable the tank to perform well in a variety of intense combat situations, simultaneously both offensively (with direct fire from their powerful main gun) and defensively (as fire support and defilade for friendly troops due to the near invulnerability to common infantry small arms and good resistance against most heavier weapons), all while maintaining the mobility needed to exploit changing tactical situations. fully integrating tanks into modern military forces spawned a new era of combat: armored warfare.

a tank is an armored fighting vehicle intended as a primary offensive weapon in front-line ground combat. tank designs are a balance of heavy firepower, strong armor, and good battlefield mobility provided by tracks and a powerful engine; usually their main armament is mounted in a turret. they are a mainstay of modern 20th and 21st century ground forces and a key part of combined arms combat.
modern tanks are versatile mobile land weapons platforms whose main armament is a large-caliber tank gun mounted in a rotating gun turret, supplemented by machine guns or other ranged weapons such as anti-tank guided missiles or rocket launchers. they have heavy vehicle armor which provides protection for the crew, the vehicle's munition storage, fuel tank and propulsion systems. the use of tracks rather than wheels provides improved operational mobility which allows the tank to overcome rugged terrain and adverse conditions such as mud and ice/snow better than wheeled vehicles, and thus be more flexibly positioned at advantageous locations on the battlefield. these features enable the tank to perform well in a variety of intense combat situations, simultaneously both offensively (with direct fire from their powerful main gun) and defensively (as fire support and defilade for friendly troops due to the near invulnerability to common infantry small arms and good resistance against most heavier weapons), all while maintaining the mobility needed to exploit changing tactical situations. fully integrating tanks into modern military forces spawned a new era of combat: armored warfare.

until the arrival of the main battle tank, tanks were typically categorized either by weight class (light, medium, heavy or superheavy tanks) or doctrinal purpose (breakthrough-, cavalry-, infantry- or reconnaissance tanks). some being larger and very heavily armored and with large guns, while others are smaller, lightly armored, and equipped with a smaller caliber and lighter gun. these smaller tanks move over terrain with speed and agility and can perform a reconnaissance role in addition to engaging enemy targets. the smaller, faster tank would not normally engage in battle with a larger, heavily armored tank, except during a surprise flanking manoeuvre.

a helicopter is a type of rotorcraft in which lift and thrust are supplied by horizontally-spinning rotors. this allows the helicopter to take off and land vertically, to hover, and to fly forward, backward and laterally. these attributes allow helicopters to be used in congested or isolated areas where fixed-wing aircraft and many forms of vtol (vertical takeoff and landing) aircraft cannot perform.
in 1942 the sikorsky r-4 became the first helicopter to reach full-scale production.although most earlier designs used more than one main rotors, the configuration of a single main rotor (monocopter) accompanied by a vertical anti-torque tail rotor has become the most common helicopter configuration.  twin-main rotor helicopters (bicopters), in either tandem or transverse rotors configurations, are also in use due to their greater payload capacity than the monorotor design.  coaxial-rotor helicopters, tiltrotor aircraft, and compound helicopters are all flying today.  quadrotor helicopters (quadcopters) were pioneered as early as 1907 in france, and other types of multicopters have been developed for specialized applications such as drones.

a book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images, typically composed of many pages (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a cover. the technical term for this physical arrangement is codex (plural, codices). in the history of hand-held physical supports for extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its predecessor, the scroll.  a single sheet in a codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page.
as an intellectual object, a book is prototypically a composition of such great length that it takes a considerable investment of time to compose and still considered as an investment of time to read. in a restricted sense, a book is a self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition, a usage that reflects the fact that, in antiquity, long works had to be written on several scrolls and each scroll had to be identified by the book it contained. each part of aristotle's physics is called a book. in an unrestricted sense, a book is the compositional whole of which such sections, whether called books or chapters or parts, are parts.
the intellectual content in a physical book need not be a composition, nor even be called a book. books can consist only of drawings, engravings or photographs, crossword puzzles or cut-out dolls.  in a physical book, the pages can be left blank or can feature an abstract set of lines to support entries, such as in an account book, an appointment book, an autograph book, a notebook, a diary or a sketchbook.  some physical books are made with pages thick and sturdy enough to support other physical objects, like a scrapbook or photograph album. books may be distributed in electronic form as ebooks and other formats.
although in ordinary academic parlance a monograph is understood to be a specialist academic work, rather than a reference work on a scholarly subject, in library and information science monograph denotes more broadly any non-serial publication complete in one volume (book) or a finite number of volumes (even a novel like proust's seven-volume in search of lost time), in contrast to serial publications like a magazine, journal or newspaper. an avid reader or collector of books is a bibliophile or colloquially, "bookworm". a place where books are traded is a bookshop or bookstore. books are also sold elsewhere and can be borrowed from libraries. google has estimated that by 2010, approximately 130,000,000 titles had been published. in some wealthier nations, the sale of printed books has decreased because of the increased usage of ebooks.
